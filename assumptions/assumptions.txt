Assumptions
1)  Combine tractor can only travel either in x or y direction. Combine tractor can turn 90 degree,
2)  Each report will be generated based on the unique combines parameters and randomly-generated obstacles location. 
3)  Based on the coordinate (x,y) of the obstacles, the combine will make decision to traverse along the x-axis or y-axis.
4)  Maximum wheel diameter = 70in
