Assumptions
1)  Combine tractors can only travel either x or y direction and turn 90 degrees
2)  Each report will be generated based on the unique combine configurations that were obtained from user input and randomly-generated obstacles locations
3)  Based on the coordinates (x,y) of the obstacles, the combine will determine whether to traverse along the x-axis or y-axis with the most efficient field coverage
4)  Maximum wheel diameter is 70 inches
5)  The Percentage Field Chosen Coverage is based on the auger length and location of the obstacles. To simplify the calculation,
    it is determined by three scenarios:
    1) All obstacles are scattered throughout the field: 3 x augerLength x fieldLength is chosen not to be planed 
    2) Two obstacles are in one group (within the auger length): 2 x augerLength * fieldLength is chosen not to be planed
    3) Three obstacles are in one group (within the auger length): 1 x augerLength * fieldLength is chosen not to be planed
