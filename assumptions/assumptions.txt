Assumptions
1)  Combine tractor can only travel either in x or y direction. Combine tractor can turn 90 degree,
2)  Each report will be generated based on the unique combine configurations that were obtained from user input and randomly-generated obstacles location. 
3)  Based on the coordinate (x,y) of the obstacles, the combine will make decision to traverse along the x-axis or y-axis and will make decision to optimize maximum field coverage
4)  Maximum wheel diameter = 70in
5)  Percentage Field Chosen Coverage is based on the auger length and location of the obstacles. To simplify the calculation,
    it is determined by three scenarios: 
    1) all obstacles are scattered all over the field: 3 x augerLength x fieldLength is chosen not to be planed. 
    2) two obstacles are in one group (within the auger length): 2 x augerLength * fieldLength is chosen not to be planed
    3) three obstacles are in one group (within the auger length): 1 x augerLength * fieldLength is chosen not be planed
    As auger gets longer, it will reduce planning time and percentage coverage.     
6)
