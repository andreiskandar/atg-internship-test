# Combine Automation Report Simulator

Create a prototype simulation for the future of agriculture harvesiting. To prove the concept of autonomous combines [harvesting tractor], a wizard input is required to configure autonomous combine and add that configuration into a database. 

All combines in the database will have a scheduled simulation test ran to log the functionality and operation of each combine to measure its efficiency through harvesting a 10-acre square field. 

Each combine is tested every hour with randomly generated obstacles placed in the square field. This app is to calculate the total time to plane the field, cost per run, percentarge planed field coverage and the total efficieny based on combine wheel diameter, auger length and fuel type. 


## Available Scripts
